Test HashSet (similar to var key hashmap tests)

Complete and test ObjectsPool

Support Initializers for multiblock IMemAllocators (variable length allocation)

Make API's get get allocated memory vs used memroy clear

Look into more traditional IMemAllocators implementations

Consider using BlockAllocator as an underlying storage of Buffer class

evaluate interesting use cases enabled by compressed pointers
  more efficient MultiSize allocator
optimize malloc/read/write/free allocators
  
Implement Set

Memory allocation:
  ByteBuffer allocator
  Unsafe Allocator
  Memory mapped file allocator?

When API stable complete tests and documentation
